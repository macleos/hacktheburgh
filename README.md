# EdiFest
**Hack The Burgh V 2019** <br />
By Samuel MacLeod, Malavika Venkatesh, Ryan Schuller & Jenny Lin


## Inspiration
We wanted a more efficient and faster way of finding nearby events. We were inspired by Tinder's swiping user interface, which enables a more interactive application.


## What it does
It is a mobile application that lets the user to go through events that will be happening in Edinburgh. The events are sorted from closest to furthest away depending on the device's location. The user can swipe left if they are not interested in the events. The user can swipe right if they are interested in the events, which will save the events. In addition, we also incorporated an extra button, so the user can click on to book the event immediately. This links to the booking page of the festival. Each event also has the price of the event displayed, to help them keep track of their financial spending.


## How we built it
We used Flutter which is Google's mobile UI framework for mobile application. Our code is written in Dart for Android devices. 


## Challenges encountered
We found that importing Android Studio was very time consuming at the start. In addition, most of us have never used Google's Flutter before, so we were learning dart as a new language. We found getting the Google API and Edinburgh Listings API provided by Craneware were difficult to try set up. We had issues with using the Google API for maps. 


## What we learned
We gained more experience in programming, and learned to program in Dart. We are more knowledgeable of the different services Google provided, especially Flutter.


## What's next for EdiFest
For the future, we would like to include Google Maps to show the distances of the different events saved, also we would like to include Google Calendar, which will show all the events in the user's Calendar. We would also like to add budgeting, to track the cost of tickets. In addition, we could integrate other events from external sources (e.g. Facebook, eventbrite etc).
